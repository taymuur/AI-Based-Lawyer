# AI-Based-Lawyer
## Design and development of an AI-based lawyer from scratch

Hiring a lawyer can get pretty expensive in Pakistan. Two non-technical investors thought of an idea to
create an AI-based lawyer that can process textual queries and answer them accordingly with citations to
the PPC (Pakistan Penal Code) and Constitution. This is especially useful for people living in remote areas
and even urban women looking to get a consultation privately
