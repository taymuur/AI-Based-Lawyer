# AI-Based-Lawyer
## Design and development of an AI-based lawyer from scratch

Hiring a lawyer can get pretty expensive in Pakistan. Two non-technical investors thought of an idea to
create an AI-based lawyer that can process textual queries and answer them accordingly with citations to
the PPC (Pakistan Penal Code) and Constitution. This is especially useful for people living in remote areas
and even urban women looking to get a consultation privately

## Functional Requirements
**Functional** requirements are product features or functions that developers must implement to enable users to accomplish their tasks. So, it’s important to make them clear both for the development team and the stakeholders. Generally, functional requirements describe system behavior under specific conditions. For example:
  - User authentication using a login username and a password
  - Error-reporting using precise and constructive error messages 
  - Process textual queries using Natural Language Processing 
  - Curate legal information based on search queries
  - Answer queries accordingly with citations to the PPC (Pakistan Penal Code) and Constitution
  - Store and organize legal files, including contracts, case files, notes, and emails 

## Non-Functional Requirements
**Nonfunctional** requirements, not related to the system functionality, rather define how the system should perform. Some examples are:
  - Safety of confidential documents and clients’ history
  - Connect to other systems like Microsoft Office to easily share files with others
  - Document automation to help law firms create documents using intelligent templates
  - Scan electronic information to obtain non-privileged information relevant to a case or claim
  - Quickly scan and search large databases of regulations, statutes, practice areas, jurisdictions, and case laws
